A Neural Network for detecting german traffic signs on the GTSRB dataset. Will later be used for a basic self-driving car simulation

Using Tensorflow and will implement cv2 for video processing once the model for detecting traffic signs, cars etc is created.

I will implement code for keeping track of the model's detections, having a 'speed' variable that will be set to the current speed limit, unless there is a stop sign or something akin to one.
